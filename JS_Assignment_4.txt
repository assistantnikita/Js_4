Day4 JavaScript Questions:
Create the Example for Logical Operators 
Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
How many operators do we have in JS ?
What is use of parseInt in js?
Take input from user and find the odd and even number.


ans.. 
// Logical AND (&&) - Returns true if both operands are true
let a = true;
let b= true;

if (a && b) {
  console.log("yes, This is true");
} else {
  console.log("No, This is false");
}

// Logical OR (||) - Returns true if at least one operand is true
let a= false;
let b= true;

if (a || b) {
  console.log(" true, a or b , one is true");
} else {
  console.log("false");
}

// Logical NOT (!) - Returns the opposite of the operand's truthiness
let winter = false;

if (!winter) {
  console.log("This is summer");
} else {
  console.log("This is winter.");
}

2. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
"=="
- this is equality operator
- it check the equality if the oprands are different type.
- console.log(1 =="1")// true

"==="
- this is strict equality operator
- it checks the equality,when both the value and data type are same.
- console.log(1 ==="1")//false


3.  How many operators do we have in JS ?
ans. 
1. Arithmetic Operators:
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
% (modulo)
++ (increment)
-- (decrement)

2. Assignment Operators:
= (assignment)
+= (addition assignment)
`-= (subtraction assignment)
*= (multiplication assignment)
/= (division assignment)
%= (modulo assignment)

3. Comparison Operators:
== (equality)
=== (strict equality)
!= (inequality)
!== (strict inequality)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)

4. Logical Operators:
&& (logical AND)
|| (logical OR)
! (logical NOT)

5. Bitwise Operators:
& (bitwise AND)
| (bitwise OR)
^ (bitwise XOR)
~ (bitwise NOT)
<< (left shift)
>> (right shift)
>>> (unsigned right shift)

6. Conditional Operator
?: (ternary operator)

7. Typeof Operator
typeof (return a datatype of particular vale)



4. What is use of parseInt in js?
ans...
the parseInt function is used to parse a string and convert it into an integer. 
let a=parseInt(prompt("enter number");
console.log(a);//45

5. Take input from user and find the odd and even number.
ans...
let a=prompt("enter a number");
a=Number(a);
if(a%2==0)
{
  console.log("even");
}
else
{
console.log("odd");
}
